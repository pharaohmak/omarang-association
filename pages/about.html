                <p>
                    Omarang Association was founded in 2000. with the purpose of providing aid and assistance to both
                    Omarang communities within the United States and those located in Sudan's Nuba Mountains. Our vision is
                    to ensure that children are given access to educational opportunities, while also helping families
                    improve their lifestyles. We strive to fulfill this mission by adhering to a code of conduct that guides
                    our efforts, based on the welfare of all Omarang people. Over the years, we've worked tirelessly to make
                    sure that everyone in these communities have access to basic resources and essential services. By
                    utilizing diverse and innovative approaches, we've been able to provide meaningful solutions that not
                    only benefit current generations, but future ones as well. Our commitment has seen us through some
                    challenging times, but thanks to our dedicated volunteers, donors, and staff members, we will continue
                    making progress towards a brighter tomorrow.
